# MIST7770-BI-Project

### MIST7770 Business Intelligence Project for the Masters of Business Analytics at UGA.

##### Problem
The team decided to solve a business problem of finding the main factors that determine car prices in used car sales. The data set is from Kaggle and has been pre-cleaned to remove null values and any other discrepancies that would affect regressions, ML algorithms, and  data visualization. 

##### Mid-Way Presentation
Presentation "BI Team Presentation Midway" shows the team's presentation to the class for the class update on project progression. We determined the key variables that affect car sales and have some descriptive visuals of the data set along with some interesting visuals to dive deeper into the assortment of variables that affect price. 

##### Final Presentation & Report
The final presentation and report are the final deliverables for the project. The report is a document detailing the descriptions, code, and visualizations for the project. The final presentation was presented to the class and professor as a final in-class deliverable.
